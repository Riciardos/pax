Event format
============

The event data structure is the centrepiece of the life of your pax plugin. Through it, your plug-in has access to the results of previously run plug-ins' work; in return, you are expected to store the fruits of your plug-in's labour at an appropriate place in the event data structure.  The following is the :class:`pax.datastructure.Event` class that you must modify.


.. autoclass:: pax.datastructure.Event
    :members:
    :undoc-members:

There are variables within the class that refer to :class:`pax.datastructure.Peak` and :class:`pax.datastructure.SumWaveform` objects.  These have their own class structure.  For example, both S1 and S2 peaks follow the following syntax.

.. autoclass:: pax.datastructure.Peak
    :members:
    :inherited-members:
    :undoc-members:

Waveforms, which are not typically saved, follow the following format.

.. autoclass:: pax.datastructure.SumWaveforms
    :members:
    :inherited-members:
    :undoc-members:
